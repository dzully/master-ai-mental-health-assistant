## Intelligent Conversational Agent for Depression Detection & Support

A research-based AI system for early depression detection through conversational analysis, implementing validated clinical methodologies and evidence-based therapeutic approaches.

## 🧠 Research Foundation

This system is built upon validated research methodologies for depression detection, incorporating:

### Clinical Assessment Tools

- **PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9)** - Standardized depression screening
- **Beck Depression Inventory** markers and indicators
- **DSM-5** diagnostic criteria integration
- **Clinical linguistic pattern analysis** from peer-reviewed research

### Machine Learning Approaches

- **K-means clustering** for user categorization (validated with k=4 and k=8)
- **Natural Language Processing** for real-time sentiment analysis
- **Linguistic pattern recognition** for depression markers
- **Risk stratification algorithms** based on clinical evidence

### Therapeutic Frameworks

- **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)** principles
- **Behavioral Activation Therapy (BAT)** strategies
- **Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)** skills integration
- **Motivational Interviewing (MI)** techniques
- **Crisis intervention protocols**

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Depression Detection Engine

```typescript
// Advanced linguistic analysis
- First-person pronoun frequency analysis
- Negation pattern recognition
- Emotional intensity measurement
- Sentence complexity assessment
- Depression keyword detection across 5 categories:
  * Cognitive indicators
  * Emotional markers
  * Behavioral patterns
  * Somatic symptoms
  * Suicidal ideation
```

#### 2. AI-Powered Analysis

```typescript
// Clinical assessment integration
- PHQ-9 score estimation
- Symptom cluster identification
- Risk factor analysis
- Protective factor recognition
- Confidence scoring with uncertainty quantification
```

#### 3. Therapeutic Response System

```typescript
// Evidence-based interventions
- Risk-stratified response protocols
- Therapeutic technique selection
- Coping strategy recommendations
- Safety planning for high-risk cases
- Professional resource referrals
```

#### 4. Real-time Monitoring

```typescript
// Continuous assessment
- Conversation pattern tracking
- Sentiment trend analysis
- Risk level escalation detection
- Session continuity management
```
